# DevBlog
# created project in MVC
# Completed building Tag model and blog model
# Build a simple form to insert tag data
# Completed Crud Operation for Tag data
# Completed Unit Testing using MSTest for Tag Crud Operation
# Minimum Integration Test Added
# Added library class and added classes but cannot implement it for unit testing. Only 3 test cases passed when I did that.
# I did unit testing and integration test both via controller from my main project.
# Got one day extension to complete check-in
# All written services code were moved inside project library.
# Model were moved inside project library.
# Unit Test and Integration testing were created and run by using project library.
# For both testing I have used an in-memory database.
# GetAllAsync_ReturnsAllTags test was failed, becuase I wanted it to fail. The assert should be set to NotEqual to pass the test.
# To add migration and update database I have used EntityFrameworkCore\Add-Migration and EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database because I messed up somewhere therefore Add-Migration and Update-Database is throwing error.
